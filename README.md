This repository contains all data for the beta alanine study analysis performed in a jupyter notebook (.ipynb filetype).
The jupyter notebook can be downloaded and the analysis replicated with the additional data uploaded to this repository.
To do so, excel files need to be downloaded and the path of the file needs to be be copied in the brackets after pd.read_excel('path')
If the execution of the code is not intended the code of the notebook can be reviewed by opening the .ipynb file.
